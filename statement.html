    <div class="title">Where's Waldo?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI created the website “Where’s Waldo?” for Assignement 1 of DATT1939. After starting the
        game, the user is
        prompted with four brown doors and an objective to Find Waldo. A hint is given to check behind one of the doors.
        This directs the user to believe that Waldo is hidden behind one of these doors. After checking behind one of
        the doors the user is directed to various other pages with blue doors, paintings of Waldo, and curtains, 
        and is prompted to find Waldo behind each of these objects. To further confuse
        the user, the paintings are recreations (by me) of famous paintings that feature Waldo. As the user checks
        behind the objects, the user soon realizes that Waldo isn’t behind any of the objects. So where is Waldo? Waldo
        is <i>HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT</i> and is actually in the title for the objective. At first glance, Waldo is
        designed to be <i>UNSEEN</i> by the user as a clickable object and/or possible answer to the objective.
        <br> <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe title is designed so the user
        thinks that the picture of Waldo is apart of the question (to show the user an example of what they are
        searching for) and not
        what they are actually searching for. Waldo is further hidden by the cursor remaining as the default style as
        the user hovers over Waldo so the user thinks they can’t click him. He may be obvious for some users at first,
        but for most people who have tried my game, they spend lots of time clicking through doors before they realize
        Waldo is <i>subtly</i> hidden in the title. The various objects that the user must check behind are designed to
        be frustrating to the user due to the repetitiveness and time it takes to check behind each one. The longer the
        user takes to find Waldo, the more thrustrated they become. Once the user
        realizes Waldo is in the title, they are mean’t to feel stupid as it was hidden in plain sight the entire time.
        All of the images were drawn by me in photoshop (and 1.5 MB or less).
        <br> <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe idea of the website was inspired by “The Impossible Quiz”, a web browser game where
        Question 12 is “CLiCK
        THE SMALLEST”. The user is then given 4 dots, but the smallest dot is actually hidden in the “i” of the
        question. The Impossible Quiz is a very thrustrating game due to the repetetiveness of having to restart after
        getting 3 questions wrong and the vagueness of each question. I played The Impossible Quiz a lot as a kid.
